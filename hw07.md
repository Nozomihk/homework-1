1）assembly language:An assembly (or assembler) language,often abbreviated asm, is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the program's statements and the architecture's machine code instructions.

2）compiler:A compiler is computer software that primarily translates computer code from a high-level programming language to machine code to create an executable program.

3)imperative programming:In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. 

4)functional programming:In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. 

5)procedural programming:Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call.
